# SCOM 2012 Maintenance Mode Tool

Putting servers into maintenance mode within the Microsoft SCOM console is a long and tedious task, especially if you have lots of servers that need to be done all at once.

In very large environments, open the SCOM management console can take a long time, you then have to search for one of your many servers, right-click, enter maintenance mode, fill out the details required (length, reason), click OK.  Rinse and repeat for your list of servers.


## My Solution

I have created an application that allows administrators to import lists of servers, and put them all into maintenance mode, with just a few clicks.  My application makes it quick and easy to search for and find the exact servers you need, add them to a list and export that list for future use.
