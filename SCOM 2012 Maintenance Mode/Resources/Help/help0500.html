Server List Options
</span></div><div class="sect">
<p>
	Once you have a list of servers you want to manage, the following options apply to the entire server list
	<ul>
		<li>Duration Or Specific Time</li>
		<li>Category</li>
		<li>Comment</li>
	<!--<li>Clusters</li>-->
		<li>WhatIf.?</li>
		<li>Schedule Task</li>
	</ul>
	These are discussed below...
</p>
<h3>Duration Or Specific Time</h3>
<p>
	This option will set the length of the maintenance window.<br/>
	You can either set a duration of the maintenance window from 10 minutes to 86400 minutes (60 days), or you can select a specific date and time in the future.<br/>	
	Make sure you set enough time to perform the work, more is better in this case.
</p>
<h3>Category</h3>
<p>
	This will set the SCOM Maintenance mode reason status for the server(s)<br/>
	If the maintenance mode is a planned one, tick the box, or untick for an unplanned maintenance window.<br/>
	From the drop down list, select the appropriate option<br/><br/>
	For more information about maintenance mode categories, see the next section on the left.
</p>
<h3>Comment</h3>
<p>
	This will set the comment for the maintenance mode reason.<br/>
	There are two reasons that SCOM uses, one is internal to the application, the other you set here.  The internal one is set to <span class="code">Planned Operating System Reconfiguration</span>
</p>
<!--
<h3>Clusters</h3>
<p>
	If you are putting an entire cluster into maintenance mode, and want to make sure the virtual cluster resources are also in maintenance, tick this box.
	This application will scan for all virtual resources and add those to the internal list of resources to set.  Check the debug auditing log for details.
</p>
-->
<h3>WhatIf.?</h3>
<p>
	Just like in Microsoft's PowerShell, this option allows you to run though the entire process, including creating the auditing log, but without making any actual changes.
</p>
<h3>Schedule Task</h3>
<p>
	This will allow you to schedule future maintenance mode operations.<br/>
	See the main help note for more information.
