Scheduled Tasks
</span></div><div class="sect">
<p>
	Scheduled tasks allow you to set a maintenance window to start sometime in the future, so that proactive and pre-planned work can be carried out.
	Setting a future start time allows administrators to monitor servers up until any planned work is due to start, without having to do this manually.<br/>
</p>
<p>
	Selecting this option, and clicking the <span class="button">Schedule Start/Update</span> button will display a new window allowing you to enter the following details...
	<ul class="compact">
		<li><strong>Task Name</strong><br/>
		A title for the scheduled task,</li>
		<li><strong>Description</strong><br/>
		A description for the task.  The list of servers will be entered automatically,</li>
		<li><strong>Start Time</strong><br/>
		When you want the scheduled task to start,</li>
		<li><strong>RunAs Username</strong><br/>
		The username to use for this scheduled task.  Make sure this user has logon rights to start scheduled jobs,</li>
		<li><strong>Password</strong><br/>
		The password for the above user.</li>
	</ul>
	
	When you click <span class="button">Create</span>, the application will:
	<ol class="compact">
		<li>Save the currently entered server list into the same folder as the application, using a unique file name,</li>
		<li>Create a new Windows scheduled task with the name provided and the name of the file to be used.<br/>
			For example: <span class="code">SCOM Maintenance Mode Task (a54722x)</span></li>
		<li>Return you to the server list, so that you can create more scheduled tasks if required</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2>Use Case Example</h2>
<p>
	If there is planned work happening over the weekend, say a Sunday between 2am and 4am, you may want to put any affected servers into maintenance mode during this time<br/>
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li>One way to do this is:
		<ol class="compact">
			<li>Wake up at 1:30am,</li>
			<li>Logon to the corporate VPN,</li>
			<li>Remote into the SCOM Management server,</li>
			<li>Find the servers, one at a time,</li>
			<li>Put them into maintenance mode manually.</li>
		</ol>
		At 1:30am, you could be half-asleep and mistakes might be made.
	</li>
	
	<li>Another way could be:
		<ol class="compact">
			<li>Pre-define the servers affected (during working hours),</li>
			<li>Wake up at 1:30am,</li>
			<li>Logon to the corporate VPN,</li>
			<li>Remote into the SCOM Management server,</li>
			<li>Put them into maintenance mode using this application.</li>
		</ol>
		At 1:30am, you could be half-asleep and mistakes might be made.
	</li>
		
	<li>With the scheduled task option:
		<ol class="compact">
			<li>Pre-define the servers affected (during working hours),</li>
			<li>Run this application using the new scheduled task option to start at 1:30am (during working hours)</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</p>
