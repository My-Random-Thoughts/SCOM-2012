Maintenance Results
</span></div><div class="sect">
<p>
	This is the tab where most of the work is actually performed.<br/>
	All the selected/entered/imported servers are listed here, sorted and grouped by domain name.
</p>
<p>
	The selected maintenance process then starts, and each server in turn is actioned.
</p>
<p>
	If the selected action (start/update/stop) is successful, three green ticks (<img src="data:image/png;base64,_16___Scan___Pass" height="16px" width="16px">) should be shown next to the server name.
<!--
	If the server has any cluster resources, and the cluster check box has been checked, then a fourth tick is also shown.
-->
</p>
<p>
	If, for any reason an issue occurs, the icons shows could either be a yellow triangle (<img src="data:image/png;base64,_16___Scan___Warning" height="16px" width="16px">) or 
	a red cross (<img src="data:image/png;base64,_16___Scan___Failed" height="16px" width="16px">), depending on the issue at hand.  A note in the auditing log will explain the exact issue.
</p>
<p>
	Generally,
	<ul>
		<li>If a <img src="data:image/png;base64,_16___Scan___Pass"    height="16px" width="16px"> green tick appears, the maintenance action was successful,</li>
		<li>If a <img src="data:image/png;base64,_16___Scan___Warning" height="16px" width="16px"> yellow triangle is shown along side green ticks for a server, then that particular monitoring item doesn't exist, or has issues,</li>
		<li>If a <img src="data:image/png;base64,_16___Scan___Failed"  height="16px" width="16px"> red cross appears, it is usually on its own, and could indicate a missing server, in which case, check you have entered it correctly.</li>
	</ul>
